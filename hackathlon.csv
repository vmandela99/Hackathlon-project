Rusinga Schools to a large measure implement existing safety and security policies and procedures. These include:
Security Policy that for example outlines the day to day procedures of manning ingress and egress points in the school.
Health and Safety Policy that summarizes the Schools role in keeping a safe environment free of occupational hazards.
Child Protection Policy that describes the schools commitment to safeguarding all children under its care.
Anti-bullying Policy which states the schools zero tolerance stance on bullying. 
We also a zero tolerance drug free zone. This is directed by a policy that is mandatory for all students to sign on entry into grade eight. 
We also hold periodic Mental Health awareness sessions (organized by our resident School Counsellor) for both parents and students as well as health camps set up in School to check basic health status.
The anti-drugs campaign is one way that the school ensures that our students are not only informed but convinced to make the right choices in life. SCAD programmes are set up once every 2-3 years to guide students from 13-16 years of age on drug awareness. 
The school has a well-equipped sick bay manned by two qualified pediatrics nurses. In case of emergencies needing evacuation to hospital, the school has contracted AAR ambulance services 
Rusinga also runs a Chaplaincy office that spearheads Pastoral programmes designed for members of the community at all levels. Collaborations with churches are in place to help in Christian spiritual grounding for all.

They appreciate the risks and rewards of running a business, the importance of health and safety and record keeping. This event is held for both our Primary and Senior School students.
This forum has been a launching pad for many business start-ups by our own students e.g.  One of our Alumni, runs a beauty and fashion line and the idea was incubated at Rusinga when she used to run a salon and massage parlour during the business days. She is now a beauty business woman in her own right and has been has been featured in one of our dailies.",Yes,"Bake sales

In the later years, from Year 3, School Prefects are elected every year through applying for the positions, stating what they will bring in. Free and fair elections of the short-listed candidates is conducted through the secret ballot from Prep School through to Senior School. Senior School has also adopted a system of Prefect Emeritus, where the outgoing Head Girl and Boy mentor the incoming Prefects body. This body presents its proposal on school improvement to the senior management and many different developments to the school programmes have been initiated by the Prefect body. They also help manage student adherence to the School Code of Conduct. The senior prefects also run the senior school assemblies where they make announcements and manage various activities. They also manage wider school events like Praise and Prize Day in ushering and maintaining general order.
The Students Council is another leadership body that comprises class representatives from all classes. Class Reps are elected at Class level from Year 3 to Year 13. In Senior School, however, the class reps also form the Students Council body from which they elect their Council President and the governing committee. The sole aim of this group is to advance school improvement at grass-root level. We encourage the student voice to be heard through these organs.
House Captains are elected largely by popular vote by their housemates to run inter-house affairs such as inter-house sports and athletics, swimming gala and inter-house co-curricular competitions across the School.
Leadership workshops and seminars for all student leaders from Prep to Senior school to strengthen their leadership potential and to equip them with leadership knowledge are scheduled for the student leadership teams every year.

Many students present proposals for CSR and engage the whole school in fundraising activities to complete projects earmarked by the students themselves. They have on-going projects that successive students continue with. 
For example, one of the projects the students support is a primary school within the environs with play equipment and mattresses for the Kindergarteners, books, stationery and building ongoing mentorship for more senior primary school children. The school reports to us that enrolment has gone up owing to Rusinga students support for the school. 
Rusinga Schools run a Community Service club which engages the local community in various charitable programmes like market clean-up.
Our students also host other children from disadvantaged environments at Rusinga during Easter and Christmas seasons to share the spirit of the two seasons.
We also have a student led charity programme to the Prayers Beyond Boundaries Homecare Centre in Maai Mahiu, Naivasha.
One of our alumnus went ahead to develop a pads initiative with a CSR component after she graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Business.   Many continue to serve in CSR initiatives after leaving Rusinga.
These and more helps the school live out its corporate social responsibility and building strong bonds between the school and the community around.
